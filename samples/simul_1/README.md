# YAFFS2 sample images

This directory contains YAFFS2 images for testing.

## Operating procedure

To generate all of them, in the /test_env, run the run.sh script that contains :
```bash
#!/bin/bash
qemu-system-x86_64  \
  -kernel arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage \
  -m 512M \
  -initrd ../initramfs.cpio.gz \
  -drive file=../rootfs_container.img,format=raw,if=virtio \
  -d guest_errors \
  -nographic \
  -serial mon:stdio \
  -append "console=ttyS0 console=/dev/console init=/init"
```

**Note** : The ext2 filesystem named rootfs_container.img can be mount after in the host environment to analyze snapshots.

```bash
cd ../test_env
./run.sh

All snapshots are saved in /mnt/disk/result/simul_1

Then exit the QEMU emulation with 

```bash
~ # halt -f
```

# Explore Snapshot

First of all you need to mount ext2 partition named rootfs_container.img with command :

```bash
#> mkdir -p recup
#> sudo mount -t ext2 -o loop  rootfs_container.img  recup/
```

In recup directory, there will be :
-recup
  - snapshot_00_empty.bin.gz
  - files_in_fs
  - result
    - simul_1
      - snapshot_00_empty.bin.gz
      - snapshot_01_add_test1.bin.gz
      - snapshot_02_creat_directories.bin.gz
      - snapshot_03_creat_link1.bin.gz
      - snapshot_04_create_named_pipe.bin.gz
      - snapshot_05_creat_block_device.bin.gz
      - snapshot_06_creat_unix_socket.bin.gz
      - snapshot_07_move_dir5_dir2.bin.gz
      - snapshot_08_delete_dir2dir5.bin.gz
      - snapshot_09_rename_dir4.bin.gz
      - snapshot_10_add_test2.bin.gz
      - snapshot_11_add_lorem.bin.gz
      - snapshot_12_truncate_lorem.bin.gz
      - snapshot_13_truncate_lorem_ORPHAN.bin.gz

If you want to explore one of them, **do not forget** to unzip it first before running **yaffs2_parser.py** tools.
